# Repo Maintenance Guidelines

- Use Vite for development and builds (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`).
- Verify code quality with `npm run lint` before committing.
- Keep `.env.example` updated with any new environment variables.
- Production deploys use Vercel with the provided `vercel.json`.
- Run `npm install` after cloning to install required dependencies.
